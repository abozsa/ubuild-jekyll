  headline: "<strong>Communication Insights</strong>"
  content: 'ActiveGuard adapts to your organization, learning the required context
    to stop targeted and socially engineered attacks. This context consolidates communication
    profiles of each member of your organization, maps internal, cross-functional
    and external relationships and enables real-time third-party risk assessment.<em>How
    this is applied in practice</em>: Phishing and other kinds of attacks reach employee
    mailboxes because current defenses only look for characteristics that are cheap
    for attackers to change (e.g. SPF) and don’t consider the context of the conversation.
    Communication insights gathered from past conversations enable ActiveGuard to
    know exactly if a given email was sent by a business partner or whether it merely
    imitates such a trusted relationship, for example by using lookalike domains.'
